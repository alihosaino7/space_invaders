## Getting Started

To run and test the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. **Using Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" Extension**:
- If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Install the "Live Server" extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
- Open the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code.
- Click on "Go Live" at the bottom-right corner of the editor.
- This will start a local server, and you can access the game at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or a different port if 5500 is already in use).
